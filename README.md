Setup the file once with a few quick steps:
1) Change Excel settings to allow you to read/write macros
2) Setup your spreadsheet's column headers for easy posting
3) Configure your POST URL so that it points to your system's form and retrieves entered data
4) Update your security settings (optional)

After setup, the user can run the following commands via the click of a button:
1) Reset the spreadsheet for the user to enter their data
2) Construct URLs based on data entered by the user
3) POST the URLs to a designated system
4) Stop the code from running at the user's command
